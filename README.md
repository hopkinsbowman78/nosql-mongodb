# nosql_challenge  

## Background

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. For this challenge, I've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.  

## Synopsis of Process

1. Read and decoded the requirements of the challenge.
